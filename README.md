You are tasked with developing a custom Shopware 6 module for managing blog posts in the administration panel. The module should allow store owners or administrators to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
Requirements:
The module should have a separate menu item in the Shopware 6 administration panel.
The module should have a list view that displays all blog posts with columns for the post title, publish date, and status (published/draft).
Clicking on a blog post in the list should open a form for editing the post content and metadata (e.g., title, description, publish date, status, etc.).
The form should include validation rules and error messages.
The form should have a "Save" button that updates the post in the database
The form should have a "Delete" button that deletes the post from the database and returns to the list view.
The module should have a "Create New Post" button that opens a blank form for creating a new blog post.
Deliverables:
A functional plugin that meets all the requirements outlined above.
Link to github repository
Bonus:
Implement a search feature to allow users to find specific blog posts.
Implement a "Bulk Actions" dropdown that allows users to delete or publish multiple posts at once.
